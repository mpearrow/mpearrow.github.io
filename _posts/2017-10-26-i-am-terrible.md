For someone who has spent most of his adult career working in Web-related 
technology, I have never kept a faithful blog or even a consistent 
brochure-style website. This is partially due to my habit of constantly trying
new web publishing platforms and tearing down old sites to make way for whatever
crazy new thing I am evaluating. 

Now is no exception. After more than a decade of drinking the CMS (content management system)
Kool-Aid, I seem to have gone full-circle back to a static website generator.
I'm evaluating Jekyll, which is a transformation engine that takes markdown or other 
similar input formats and transforms it into static HTML. It might seem like a step back
into the 1990's. and in some ways, it is. However, very little of what goes on a blog where
you don't want comments requires the overhead of a server-side executable framework.

So, I'm going green for a while, and will see how long it takes before I tear this site down
and replace it with something new.
