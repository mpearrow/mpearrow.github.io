I'm Mark J. Pearrow. I live in Dedham, Massachusetts, and I'm originally from Little Rock, Arkansas. 

In the 1990's I was in a band whose name made the [Canonical list of Bad Band Names][clbbn] - Techno-Squid Eats Parliament.
We were a four-piece band that played all-original music, written by band members Clay Bell and Aaron Sarlo. I 
Played bass in the band, and was also the science officer and resident nerd for the band. You can read more 
about the band on [the Wikipedia article][wikipedia]. In 1995, the band broke up;  Aaron and I stayed in
the Boston area, while Clay and Shayne (the drummer) returned to California and Arkansas, respectively.

After that life-shattering event, I somehow managed to wind up at MIT and began a new career in UNIX system administration.
I soon became enchanted with the World Wide Web, even though my initial contact with it was pretty lame. While travelling
with the band to the LA headquarters for Philips Media, I met a young software engineer who had set up a thing called a 
"webcam" on the "web" and it allowed him to look at his favorite houseplant, a succulent, in his apartment, while he was at work.
I had decided then and there that the Web was dumb. I gave it a second chance eventually.
